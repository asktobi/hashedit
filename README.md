# HL or High-Level

	High-Level is a project for a low level compiler
	So why is it High Level you ask ?
	Well i guess its just opposite day today, huh

##Goals
	- Compiler
	- live-enviroment
	- std-library (first x86_64)
	- netcode
	- audiocode
	- ... std-web
	- ... Alexa Clone ?

###Compiler
	Provide a simple jit-compiler that can live be interpreted checked for errors and loaded into memory
	It should compile to x86_64 and all common platforms at some point.
	
###live-enviroment
	A live development platform for the compiler that acts as a ide also.

###std-librarys
	I want to keep it as low level as possible because i kinda have the intention to run this one bare 
	hardware in the future (This is for the invisioned "Alexa Clone ?").

###netcode
	Implement a simple but secure networkstack.
	Sharing of Interfaces, Public Data, and functions. 
	It can also act as a public messeging system.

###audiocode
	Searching for the best format.
	Maybe write some format converters.

###std-web
	Implementing all the common web protocolls

##Alexa Clone ?

	I want to have a secure and flexibly extensible human voice interface device xD
	Basicly Alexa and Echo fully programmable with voice and live calls ...
	Could detect the differences in each voice for Security.
